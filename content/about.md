Emerson Ruffin is a digital illustrator, fashion designer and motivational speaker from Philadelphia PA.
He is self-taught, beginning with paper and pencil as a child; then moving to experimentation with Adobe Photoshop in his teens. As an adult he was able to purchase an iPad where he began working out his designs using Procreate. This marked a major turning point in his ability to give incredible attention to detail in digital illustration.


Emerson’s signature style ‘see sound’ often depicts a ballet showing a blending of faces and symbols in smoke-like highlights. These are the usual suspects seen in his impressive body of work.
