This is not just a dress, this is WEARABLE LITERATURE! This is the power of a conversation that ended up as a sketch on an iPad Pro, an idea as a representation of our african lineage/ancestry, woven into fabric made into a dress meant to be worn at an extravagant event. We inherited a responsibility to tell the stories of our ancestors because theyâ€™re no longer here to tell it themselves. I believe we accomplish that on this day. 11/16/19
