          Emerson Ruffin is a digital illustrator, fashion designer and motivational speaker from Philadelphia PA. He is self-taught, beginning with paper and pencil as a child; then moving to experimentation with Adobe Photoshop in his teens. As an adult he was able to purchase an iPad where he began working out his designs using Procreate. This marked a major turning point in his ability to give incredible attention to detail in digital illustration.

          This is not just a dress, this is WEARABLE LITERATURE! This is the power of a conversation that ended up as a sketch on an iPad Pro, an idea as a representation of our african lineage/ancestry, woven into fabric made into a dress meant to be worn at an extravagant event. We inherited a responsibility to tell the stories of our ancestors because theyâ€™re no longer here to tell it themselves.
